Environment Variables for build...
==================================

This is what mariosgit uses to build the firmwares.
Instead of changing makefiles, set the following env vars...

From the doc...
> If you want to set up your own environment to build Elementsâ€™ code, an ARM EABI toolchain must be installed. Because of tight CPU and code size limits, we recommend you to use the same compiler version as we do: 4.8-2013-q4-major. Various pre-compiled binaries and source packages are available [here](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/4.8/4.8-2013-q4-major/) .

```
export TOOLCHAIN_PATH=/Volumes/OS_MBP_108/Applications//Arduino_1_6_0.app/Contents/Java/hardware/tools/gcc-arm-none-eabi-4.8.3-2014q1/
# export TOOLCHAIN_PATH=/Volumes/OS_MBP_108/Applications/Arduino_1_8_1.app/Contents/Java/hardware/tools/arm/
export PGM_INTERFACE=stlink-v2-1
export PGM_SERIAL_PORT=/dev/tty.usbserial-A5XK3RJT
````

```
export AVRLIB_TOOLS_PATH=/Volumes/OS_MBP_108/Applications/Arduino_1_6_0.app/Contents/Java/hardware/tools/avr/bin/
export AVRDUDE=$(AVRLIB_TOOLS_PATH)avrdude -C $(AVRLIB_TOOLS_PATH)../etc/avrdude.conf 
```
The latter is not really checked in the makefile (avrlib/makefile.mk:70)

Then follow instructions on webpage.
